    <p>My name is Serik Darkan Serikuly, I was born on January 11, in 2004 in the city of <strong>Atyrau</strong>.
      I am a 1-st year student at <a href="https://astanait.edu.kz/"><strong>Astana IT University</strong></a>.</p>
    <p>There are 3 people in our family. Mom's name is Ainur. Dad's name is Serik.
      I have been living in <strong>Nur-Sultan</strong> since 2013.
      And I want to tell you about myself in detail.
      First, about my family.
      I am the only son at home.</p>
  </div>
  <h3><em>My Family:</em></h3>
  <img src="assets/myfamily.jpeg" alt="MyFamily" width="350" height="466" style="border:5px solid brown">
  <textarea rows="31" cols="53" autofocus>
    As you can see, there are three of us in the family. And I think this is more of a difference than a disadvantage. First of all, it is good for me that I am an only child in the family, others think so. But I certainly think the opposite. I would be glad if there was another child in my family. I would be even more glad if it was my sister. Well, or was there an older brother. It's great when you have someone to rely on. Another difference between our family and others is age. We have very different ages. Dad is 55, mom is 47, and I am 17. Why do you think there is such a difference in age: Because dad was in no hurry to get married. Mom was in no hurry either. But the most interesting thing is that they met for about 3 months and got married right away. Then Dad was a fisherman and earned good money. And my mother studied. In her youth, she studied and worked. But of course, I studied on the bigger side. And they were introduced, their mutual friend. It all started with this. They got married in 2002 and got engaged near the Caspian Sea. And I was born in 2004. Dad was very happy when I was born. He celebrated 40 days as they say. But there was one thing. I was not born completely healthy. But luckily, I recovered with the help of doctors and my parents. And so the years passed. We lived in the city of Atyrau. And in 2013 we moved to Astana. We didn't know what to do. But we believed that we would succeed. And right now, I can proudly say that we have succeeded, and will still succeed. And in the end. I may have a small family, but with a big soul. I love my family.</textarea>

      then I decided not to give up and go all the way. And I took part in the international Olympiad. And then it did not work to take a seat. Well, it seems not so, and I'm really smart. Yes, my achievements are few, but they are.</em>
